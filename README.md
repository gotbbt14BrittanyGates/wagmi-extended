# wagmi-extended

`wagmi-extended` is a powerful library that builds on [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [Viem](https://viem.sh/), and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5) to deliver extended hooks and helper functions for Ethereum and blockchain development with React.
<br /><br />
It simplifies tasks like fetching token metadata, handling ERC20 approvals, sending transactions, writing contracts and getting user friendly error message.
<br /><br />
Our library adheres to one core principle: **always wait for a transaction receipt**. This guarantees that your dApps capture transaction outcomes reliablyâ€”no manual state management or race conditions required.
<br /><br />
Whether you're building a DeFi platform, a governance system, or any blockchain solution, `wagmi-extended` offers a consistent, reliable, and developer-friendly interface, trusted in production with over $500M in volume.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install wagmi-extended
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add wagmi-extended
```

## Requirements

Your project must include the following peer dependencies:

- **React**: ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0
- **Wagmi**: ^2.0.0
- **Viem**: ^2.0.0
- **@tanstack/react-query**: ^5.0.0

> **Note:** : You must wrap your application with necessary providers (e.g. QueryClientProvider from TanStack Query and WagmiProvider).

## Playground

Compare wagmi-extended with standard wagmi implementations in our interactive CodeSandbox project. [View the CodeSandbox Project](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/5jr3lg) to explore its features and see how it works in practice!

### API

You can import all the functions and hooks directly from `wagmi-extended`. For example:

```bash
import {
  useTokenX,
  useERC20ApproveX,
  useSendTransactionX,
  useWriteTransactionX,
  setDefaults,
  getDefaults,
} from "wagmi-extended";
```

Each hook is documented with detailed JSDoc comments (including usage examples) in the source code. Refer to that documentation for additional details.

## Hooks explanations and examples

### useERC20ApproveX Hook

The `useERC20ApproveX` hook simplifies ERC20 token approvals by checking the allowance and handling the transaction to approve transfers.

Example:

```bash
import { useERC20ApproveX } from "wagmi-extended";

function ApproveButton(amountToApprove: number) {
  const tokenAddress = "0xTokenAddress";      // Replace with your token address
  const spenderAddress = "0xSpenderAddress";  // Replace with the spender address

  const { isApproved, isApproving, approveAsync } = useERC20ApproveX(
    tokenAddress,
    spenderAddress,
    parseUnits(amountToApprove.toString(), 18),
  );

  return (
    <button onClick={approveAsync} disabled={isApproving || isApproved}>
      {isApproving ? "Approving..." : isApproved ? "Approved" : "Approve Token"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### useContractWriteX hook

The `useContractWriteX` hook wraps the contract-writing functionality from Wagmi with additional features like `receipt` waiting, `logging` control, and `query invalidation` after receipt is successfully fetched.

Example:

```bash
function MyTransactionComponent() {
const { writeContractAsync, isPending, errorMessage } = useContractWriteX({
    queriesToInvalidate: [["userBalance"], ["userActivity"]],
});

const handleWrite = async () => {
    try {
      const txHash = await writeContractAsync({
        address: "0xContractAddress",
        abi: [], // Provide your contract ABI
        functionName: "executeFunction",
        args: [/* function arguments */],
      }, {
        // use calbacks here in writeContractAsync or in useContractWriteX
        onSuccess: (txHash) => console.log("Transaction successful:", txHash),
        onError: (error) => console.error("Transaction error:", error),
      });
      console.log("Received txHash:", txHash);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed writing transaction:", err);`
    }
};

return (
    <div>
    <button onClick={handleWrite} disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? "Processing..." : "Write Transaction"}
    </button>
    {errorMessage && <p>Error: {errorMessage}</p>}
    </div>
);
}
```

### useSendTransactionX Hook

The `useSendTransactionX` hook wraps the transaction-sending functionality from Wagmi with additional features like `receipt` waiting, `logging` control, and `query invalidation` after receipt is successfully fetched.

Very similar to useContractWrite, see [playground](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/5jr3lg) for example.

### useTokenX Hook

The useTokenX hook fetches token metadata (symbol, decimals, name and symbol) for a given token address using React Query and your Wagmi configuration.

```bash
import { useTokenX } from "wagmi-extended";
import { Address } from "viem";

function TokenDisplay({ tokenAddress }: { tokenAddress: Address }) {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useTokenX(tokenAddress);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading token data...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Symbol: {data.symbol}</p>
      <p>Decimals: {data.decimals}</p>
      <p>Name: {data.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Non-hook functions setup

**Feel free to skip Setup-section if using only hooks - no fetch methods directly**
<br />
For easier use of fetch (non hook) functions setup the default configuration.
<br />
This is done by calling `setDefaults` in your application initialization (e.g., in index.tsx or App.tsx).

Example:

```bash
// index.tsx (or App.tsx)
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useConfig } from "wagmi";
import { setDefaults } from "wagmi-extended";
import { wagmiConfig } from "/your/path/to/wagmi-config";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
// Obtain your Wagmi configuration from your initialization or provider

// Set defaults for the extended library functions.
setDefaults(queryClient, wagmiConfig);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Error Handling

The library provides a built-in error mapping mechanism to transform raw errors into user-friendly messages. This is especially useful when working with smart contracts that may revert with different kinds of errors.

> **Note:** : mapper is just a `fallback` if error message can't be understood from ABIs.

Example: Override the default allowance error message and add a new custom error. Provide error type (name), signature or reason and string as a message.

```bash
setErrorMapping({
  ErrorNotEnoughAllowance: "Custom message: Please approve tokens first!",
  NewCustomError: "A custom error occurred.",
  "0xea8d7f02":
    "Action exceeded safe slippage parameters, please try again later",
});
```

> **Note:** : this `EXPANDS` the current object, it doesn't override.

This is default error mapper, feel free to create PR to extend it as well:

```bash
const defaultErrorMapping: Record<string, string> = {
  EnforcedPause: "Temporary pause in effect, please check Discord for updates.",
  ErrorNotEnoughAllowance:
    "Not enough allowance, did you approve your tokens first?",
  "0xc2139725": "Not enough allowance, did you approve your tokens first?",
  SharesReceivedBelowMinimum:
    "Action exceeded safe slippage parameters, please try again later",
  "0xea8d7f02":
    "Action exceeded safe slippage parameters, please try again later",
  MaxSlippageExceeded:
    "Action exceeded safe slippage parameters, please try again later",
  "51": "Supply cap exceeded",
};
```

> **Note:** : if you don't like initial error mapping and messages, you can call `resetErrorMapping()` which will reset the mapping to `{}`.

### fetchTokenX

Example:

```bash
const tokensData = await Promise.all(tokenAddresses.map((token) =>
  fetchTokenX(token);
));
```

> **Note:** : if you did not setup defaults (queryClient and wagmi config) you can call by passing client and config as params: `fetchTokenX(token, queryClient, wagmiConfig)`.
